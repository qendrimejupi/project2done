			<p>I have a wonderful family and love all my family members. My family consist of four members. It includes me, my parents and my sister. I have very sweet and loving parents, they both care for me a lot. All my family members love, respect and care for each other. My family goes for a picnic once every two weeks. We all love to spend time with each other after dinner every night. It is because of them that I have learned basic value of life. We share all our problems and take suggestions from one another. The time we get to spend with each other is precious and I enjoy it very much. In the end my family is a sweet and happy family.</p>

			<h2>Toby</h2>

		<p><strong>Toby it's my dog</strong> Everywhere I go I encounter dogs: on the sidewalk, in the parks, in stores and airports, at readings, at my dog cognition lab. Most of the dogs are with people. Consequently, it is not long before I hear people talking to their dogs. Sure, much of what we say to dogs is request or command, exclamation points implied: Sit; Come; Go Get Your Ball. Once I began really listening, though, what surprised me was how much is not  mere directive.</p>
