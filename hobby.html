			<h2>Hobby</h2>
			<span class="byline">Hobbies play a very important role in our life, they keeps us busy in spare hours and make life happy. They makes us to forget worries and give us inspiration. It was has away monotony and gives fresh energy. A hobby to me is something that relaxes your minds and allows me to be creative. Having good hobies fill up free time makes people less likely to spent their idle time an wasteful or negative activities. There are many hobbies like reading, drawing, cooking, singing. My favorite hobby is reading. I read story books, newspaper. This hobby got started when I was a little boy. I had always wanted my parents to read fairy tales and other stories  to me.  The wonderful about reading is that I do not have to learn things the hard way. 
Books provide the reader with so much information and facts. They have certainly helped me in daily life. I am better equipped to cope with living.</span>
